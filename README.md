Back to school to learn about equations and all the stuff I could not care about in my innocent youth. In Python.

## The project
The goal of this project is to create a program that can solve polynomial equations up to the second degree. The program will take an equation as input, reduce it to its simplest form, and then provide the solution(s) to the equation.
I am specifically doing this project to hone my skills in Python programming and mathematics.
